    Hello guys<br/>
    Welcome to Berlin, the heart of Germany and the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population.[8][9] Its more than 3.85 million inhabitants[10] make it the European Union's most populous city, according to population within city limits.[2] One of Germany's sixteen constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital. 
    Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the most populous urban area in Germany.
    [3][11] The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region
